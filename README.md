# EventMeUp

A simple web application to create, organise and share events with your friends!

## Feature ideas (user stories)

**v1.0**

> As a user, I want to be able to create an account and login / logout using that account.

> As a user, I want to be able to access events created by myself / others using an url without login. I want to be able to sign up, decline or set myself to tentative to the event with a name I choose. I also want to be able to add a personal comment regarding my sign up status.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to see all events I created in the future and the recent past.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to edit and delete events I created.

**Future versions**

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to create a PDF for an event I created which contains a QR code with the link to the event.

> As a user, I want to be able to download an export of an event which I can import into a calendar.

> As a user, I want to be able to see a list of events from a certain organiser.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to set a deadline for signups to events I created.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to decide whether my created event is public, hidden or private. Public events are accessible for everyone using the url and show up in event lists (like the list of events of which I am the organiser), hidden events are accessible for everyone using the url, but don't show up in event lists and private events are only visible for logged in users which were given permission to access the event.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to add other users as editors of events I created.

> As a user, I want to be able to login / logout using my Facebook, Google or Microsoft Account.

> As a user, I want to be able to suggest an alternative date or location for an existing event.

> As a logged in user, I want to be able to hide the participants for events I created.

> As a user, I want to be able to select the language for the application. I want to be able to choose from English, German and Swiss German.
